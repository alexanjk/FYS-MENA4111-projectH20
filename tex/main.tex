    Quinizarin can function as an organic sensetizer in an upconversion system. In ALD the organic molecule can possibly be deposited in a matrix of lanthanide flouride, to increase the efficiency of the upconversion process in the material. To see how this efficiency can increase and what energy levels can be absorbed by the material, it is wise to investigate the electronic band structure of the molecule. This paper will look in to Quinizarin's own electronic properties, as well as, Quinizarin with lanthanides replacing one a Hydrogen atom, to emulate Quinizarin inside the structure in a simple way.

\section{Introduction}  \label{sec:Introduction}

    Photons can be used for many things. However, not all photons are created equal. They come in many different energies, and not all energies are as simple to absorb. A way to increase the efficiency of photon-absorbing materials is by modifying it so that it can absorb photons with a low energy, collect that energy, and re-emit the photon with higher energy. This is known as up-conversion and has many uses. One use is to increase the efficiency of solar panels by allowing it to collect more of the sunlight, where the up-conversion system can be a thin-film on the top of the panel. A different use is to increase the energy to the point where the emitted photon can become ionizing and work as a bacteria or virus killer.\\

    Up-conversion is a phenomenon where incoming photons are re-emitted with a higher energy than they entered with. The photons excite electrons in a material, and by conduction of those electrons they can move to other atoms, where they are further excited. The electron ends up in a high energy state and de-excites releasing all the energy. However, the process can be very inefficient due to narrow energy bands in the material. A form of increasing this efficiency is by adding a material with a wide energy band to allow absorption of photons with more varied energy.\\

    This paper will focus on an organic compound known as Quinizarin. The compound is an organic dye and has a broad energy band. This means it can absorb a broad spectrum of photons energies. The excited electrons from this energy band can move to the actual up-conversion system and hereby increase the efficiency of the up-conversion. The planned up-conversion system will consist of Quinizarin as an organic sensitizer, Nd+3 and Yb+3 as electron migrators (transporting the electrons to the site of de-excitation), and Tm+3 as accumulator and activator (collecting excited electrons and up-converting them, and de-excitation site for said electrons). The system is planned to be inserted into a matrix of YbF3 or possibly YF3.\\

    Since Quinizarin is such an important piece of the system it is wise to know how it interacts with the other materials. This study will therefore investigate how Quinizarin's electronic band structure changes when the Hydrogen in the alcohol group is replaced with different atoms. In this case: Yb, Nd, Tm and Y. See figure~(\ref{fig:Quinizarin-X} for an illustration).\\

\section{Method}    \label{sec:Method}

  The supercomputer Saga contains many different POSCAR-files for a wide range of structures. Unfortunately for us, Quinizarin was not included. Therefore we had to make our own POSCAR-file. This was done by drawing the structure in an organic compound structure program we found on the internet: \href{https://molview.org}{MolView}. This site lets the user draw organic structures with many varying features, and it also lets the user export the data as a \texttt{.mol}-file. A \texttt{.mol}-file has a similar structure with a POSCAR-file, which let us easily make the POSCAR-file for Quinizarin. \\

  The coordinates of the atoms in the \texttt{.mol}-file were put in a POSCAR file with Direct coordinates. We added a unit cell and, and opened it in VESTA. In order to make the plane-waves more stable for the calculations, we inserted a vacuum distance in each direction of 12 Å. \\

  To differentiate the two Hydrogen-atoms in the alcohol-groups from the other Hydrogen-atoms, we had to find their positions somehow. This was done in the program GeoGebra, by plotting each atom with their positions in 3D. We found that the Hydrogen-atoms were number 25 and 26 in POSCAR. In hindsight, we discovered that this would be easier to do in VESTA. \\

  In this project we will compare the basic Quinizarin with Quinizarin with both Yttrium (Y) and Ytterbium (Yb) substituted in the Hydrogen-positions described in the subsection above. Therefore we had to make in total three POSCAR-files for the three structures. This was done by opening POSCAR in Emacs and changing the two last atoms given in the file to the substitution-atoms. After that we ran in to issues with relaxing the structure, and so went to the ICSD database to find a decent distance between the new atoms and oxygen. We used approximately 2.3 Å in distance, and that worked well for relaxing the structure. \\


  \subsection{Convergence}  \label{sec:Convergence}

    Testing for convergence of energy and k-point is important to determine if the variables in INCAR or KPOINTS are good enough to be used for further calculations, mostly to ensure decent and applicable results. If the error is less than $1\cdot 10^{-3}$ the calculation can be considered converged. \\

    The testing of convergence is done by performing VASP calculations with different values of either energy-cutoff (ENCUT) or k-point density. For this project the energy convergence testing was done for ENCUT between 300 and 900 eV, with 50 eV steps. The k-point convergence testing was done for k-point density between 1.0 and 6.0, with 1.0 difference. For the aforementioned test the value for ENCUT was decided from the energy convergence test. \\


  \subsection{Relax}

    A relaxing calculation is performed to minimize the max force of the material. This is done by moving the atoms to find the optimal atom positions for the structure. \\

    We performed the relaxation calculation once for each structure. \\


  \subsection{Static}

    A static calculation is a calculation in which atoms are held at their original positions. These are often used for obtaining a converged energy, as calculations that relax the structure are less safe to use for this.\\

    In this project we have performed static calculations both before and after performing ionic relaxation. The static calculations that were performed before relaxation were to see how the energies changed between before and after relaxation. \\


  \subsection{DOS}

    A plot of density of states shows the at what levels the energy bands, or orbitals, exists and how broad they are. A band with a high density of states allows for more electrons to occupy it, whereas a band with a low density of states allows for fewer. The density of states is generally plotted against the energy, and peaks in the plot show how many electrons are allowed to exist at a specific energy. An energy gap is shown by two peaks separated by a void. The size of the void (span in energy) is the height of the energy gap. \\

    For obtaining a plot of density of states we ran the script dosplot.py for the values generated by the post-relaxation static calculations. This ensured that the values were converged and safe to use. dosplot.py reads the DOSCAR-file and plots the values in an easy-to-read format. \\


  \subsection{Bang gap}

    The density of states plots show where the band gap is located, but it does not give the numerical value. VASP has the command \texttt{bandgap} specifically for this, hence we used this to find the numerical value of the band gap for the structures. \\


  \subsection{Charge density}

    The charge density of a structure shows how the charge is distributed around the atoms in that structure. A plot of the charge density therefore shows how many electrons the different atoms attract. To plot the charge density the file CHGCAR, after a completed VASP calculation, is copied over to VESTA, and then visualized.

\section{Results}   \label{sec:Results}

  \subsection{Convergence of energy}

     The energy convergence tests were run as described in Section \ref{sec:Convergence}. After the runs were completed we looked at vaspout from each of the runs. The total energy per atom, or TOTEN/atom, was plotted against the cutoff energy and this is shown in Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_energy}). \\

     Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_energy_difference}) shows the difference in energy from one value to the next. This means, the value of ENCUT=300 is the difference in total energy going a cutoff energy of 300 eV to 350 eV. \\

  \subsection{Convergence of k-points}

    For the convergence of k-points the span of values were used as described in Section \ref{sec:Convergence}. Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_kpoints}) shows how the total energy changes as k-density increases. Like with energy, the difference has also been plotted, and this is shown in Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_kpoints_difference}).

  \subsection{Quinizarin}

    \subsubsection{Relaxing the structure}

      The initial static calculation of Quinizarin gave a CONTCAR as shown in Figure~(\ref{fig:basic_staticbefore_CONTCAR}). \\

      After relaxing the structure and performing a new static calculation, CONTCAR looked as shown in Figure~(\ref{fig:basic_staticafter_CONTCAR}). We do not show CONTCAR from the actual ionic relaxation as it is identical to the post-relaxation static calculation. \\

      Table~(\ref{tab:neighborquinizarin}) shows how the distance between Hydrogen and Oxygen changes from before and after relax. \\

    \subsubsection{Total and relative energies}

      As can be seen in Table~(\ref{tab:TOTENquinizarin}), there was a difference in total energies. This turned out to be -0.015 eV in relative energy difference. The data is taken from static calculations of Quinizarin, before and after a relax VASP calculation. \\

    \subsubsection{Total and local density of states}

      In Figure~(\ref{fig:basic_TDOS_2}) we can see the total density of states of the Quinizarin molecule.

It is important to note that these figures are zoomed in around the Fermi-level.

\section{Discussion}    \label{sec:Discussion}

  \subsection{Convergence of energy}

    Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_energy}) shows that the values change quite rapidly and reach a peak around cutoff 500 eV which then lowers and stabilizes near cutoff 800 eV. However, the values differ by a very small amount, which can indicate that one needs a smaller cuttoff energy than 800. Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_energy_difference}) also indicates this. \\

    From Section~\ref{sec:Convergence} we learned that if the difference in energy is less than 0.003 eV the calculation can be considered converged. The figure shows that ENCUT=450 is below 0.002 eV in difference from ENCUT=500. This shows that ENCUT=450 is safe enough to use. This can seem weird due to it being before a peak and the stabilized total energy is lower, but the values are quite small, and overall should not impact the results in a meaningful way. \\

  \subsection{Convergence of k-points}

    There were fewer data points than with the energy convergence, so it is not as easy to find a pattern as it was with the convergence of energy. For Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_kpoints}) one can see the energy increases to a peak around 4.0 and 5.0 in k-density, which then decreases at k-density 6.0. Due to the lack of a good pattern we quickly moved on to Figure~(\ref{fig:convergence_kpoints_difference}) which showed even less of a converging pattern. However, already at k-density 1.0 we could see the difference was less than 0.003 eV. Since the difference increased again with 2.0, we wondered if we could use 3.0, but after a few test-calculations with both 1.0 and 3.0 we found the difference was negligible and so we chose to use 1.0. \\


  \subsection{Quinizarin}

    Figure (\ref{fig:basic_staticbefore_CONTCAR}) and Figure (\ref{fig:basic_staticafter_CONTCAR}) compares how the Quinizarin structure differs from before and after a relaxing computation. By examining the figures, there are virtually no difference to be seen. However, Table (\ref{tab:neighborquinizarin}) shows that there actually are a difference. Before relax, the Hydrogen-atoms are at a distance of about 1.75 Å to the double-bonded Oxygen-atoms and at about 0.95 Å to the single-bonded Oxygen-atoms. After relax, the distance has shrunk substantially to the double-bonded Oxygen-atoms to about 1.58 Å. On the contrary has the distances to the single-bonded Oxygen-atoms increased to about 1.03 Å, therefore the change is not as large as for the double-bonded distance. These changes implies a shift of the placement of the Hydrogen-atoms, where they now are closer to the double-bonded Oxygen-atoms than the single-bonded. This shift is explained by that Quinizarin has a resonance structure. A resonance structure implies that an atom has the possibility to shift placement in the structure. In this case for Quinizarin, this means that the Hydrogen-atoms can shift between the double-bonded Oxygen and the single-bonded Oxygen in the alcohol group. Such a shift has another implication, namely that the bond between the Oxygen-atoms and the Carbon-atoms change. For instance if the Hydrogen-atom has a shift further to the left, therefore shorter distance to the double-bonded Oxygen, will the Oxygen-bond to the Carbon have to change to a single-bond to maintain that Oxygen only can share to bonds. The Oxygen in the, now former, alcohol group then has a dangling bond, and forms a double-bond with the Carbon. For this to happen the activation energy has to be enough to break both the single-bond and the double-bond. We do not know the activation energy for Quinizarin, and could not examine when this change in structure forms in this project. However, this is interesting to study for another project. \\

    Table (\ref{tab:TOTENquinizarin}) shows the total energies before and after the relax computation. The total energy after relax is less than before, which is in accordance to that a relaxing computation should make the structure more stable, implying a smaller total energy. The relative energy difference is $-0.015$ eV. \\

    \textbf{\textit{DENSITY OF STATES OG BAND GAP}} \\

    As for the change in the structure before and after relaxation, the charge density has also not changed much. Figure (\ref{fig:basic_staticbefore_CHGCAR}) and Figure (\ref{fig:basic_staticafter_CHGCAR}) displays the charge density for before relax and after relax, respectively. Table (\ref{tab:neighborquinizarin}) shows that the Hydrogen-atoms move some, but this is not possible to see in the charge density figures either.



  \subsection{Quinizarin with Yttrium}

    From relaxing the structure we can see that the atomic distances between the Yttrium and Oxygen atoms decreases. This can both be seen visually in Figure~(\ref{fig:Y_staticbefore_CONTCAR}) and Figure~(\ref{fig:Y_staticafter_CONTCAR}), as well as from the numbers in Table~(\ref{tab:neighborY}). This shows that the initial distances found in ICSD for Ytterbium were not identical for Yttrium. This is good. It was still wise to use 2.32 Å as start distance as the start distance from normal Quinizarin made the molecule explode during ionic relaxation with standard parameters. Another thing to note is how Yttrium is almost in the middle. The initial coordinates also kept Yttrium in the middle, but it is interesting to note how it kept in the middle. It is only 0.01 Å closer to the alcohol-group Oxygen than to the double-bonded Oxygen. This indicates that what used to be double bonds now are single bonds and that both Oxygen's are equally bonded to Yttrium. This is a further step from the resonant structure that was discussed for the normal Quinizarin molecule. \\

    As seen in Table~(\ref{tab:TOTENY}) The energy of Quinizarin with Yttrium after ionic relaxation is lower than before ionic relaxation. This proves that the relaxed structure indeed is relaxed, and shows it being more stable. The relative energy was $-0.109$ eV/atom which shows there was a change, but not a too big one. \\

    The plot over total density of states for Quinizarin with Yttrium shows that there is an orbital at the fermi level. This means that the orbital is half-full which may indicate that Quinizarin has an unpaired electron spin, making the molecule weakly paramagnetic. \\

    The band gap was reported to be $0.029$ eV as shown in Table~(\ref{tab:bandgapY}). This is very small and less trustworthy than looking at the density of states.





  \subsection{Quinizarin with Ytterbium}








  \subsection{Quinizarin with Neodymium and Thulium}

    \textbf{\textit{MANGLER TEKST}}

    We attempted to perform relaxation and evaluation of Quinizarin with Neodymium and Thulim as well. Initially we attempted with the relaxed Hydrogen-system as POSCAR for these atoms, but the distance was way to low. This resulted in an explosion of the molecule a lack of relaxation. We then tried to relax with more electronic steps, but this did not help. This was also the case for Y and Yb initially. After using around 2.3 Å as distance (after looking at various solid structures on ICSD) we managed to get a relaxed structure for Y and Yb. However, this was not the case for Nd and Tm. We then tried to increase the amount of electronic steps, NELM, to 300, without success. We cross-checked some Nd-structures on ICSD, but 2.3 Å seemed reasonable to use. After a final attempt with IBRION=2 and POTIM=0.2 we hoped for a better result. This was not the case, as after 3 hours it still had not converged. We weighed our options of either increasing the maximum time, or to stop trying with Nd and Tm. After a talk with our supervisors we decided to only report for Y and Yb.
